1. install:
        a. mysql, use 8.0.20 or above
        b. intellj idea (community server will work)
        c. java 8 (can be download after installed intellj)
        d. clone the git to a local file. After cloned, you should have a file name demo under your path.
        e. a way to send http request (curl command or sth else). I prefer postman.
2. intellj import project
        a. click file - new - project from existing source -> choose demo -> select as maven project -> finish import
           once imported, give intellj a little time to install all required dependency.
3. start mysql
        a. create data using data.sql under resources file
        b. check application.yml, make sure it has the correct config for mysql (username, pass, port, db name)
4. run program using demo/src/main/java/com/SecureMessage/demo/DemoApplication.
5. send an http get request with username a, password a, index 5
    request looks like http://localhost:9090/query?username=a&password=a&index=5

    if using data.sql, should get 1K0IYR7ZUcX2HDXuVnOJ as response.
    console will also generate the attacker's observation.

note for part 5, username, password, index and response is subject matter to data.sql, you can use your only data as well;
